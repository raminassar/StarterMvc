AspNet-Identity-2-With-Integer-Keys
===================================

This project approches a little more advanced customization of the ASP.NET Identity 2.0 RTM framework. The project accompannies a blog post which walks through the basics of implementing integer keys instead of the default string keys which Identity uses out-of-the-box. The project starts with the Identity Samples project available from Nuget.

The post which accompanies this example can be found at [ASP.NET Identity 2.0 Extending Identity Models and Using Integer Keys Instead of Strings](http://typecastexception.com/post/2014/07/13/ASPNET-Identity-20-Extending-Identity-Models-and-Using-Integer-Keys-Instead-of-Strings.aspx)
